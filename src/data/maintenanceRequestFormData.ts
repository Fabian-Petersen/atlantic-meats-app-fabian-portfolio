// Emergency/Critical (A-Level): Immediate action needed; production down, severe safety risk, major environmental hazard.
// High Priority (B-Level): Significant risk of failure or production loss; needs prompt attention, often scheduled soon.
// Medium Priority (B/C-Level): Prevents future issues or performance degradation; less urgent but important.
// Low Priority (C-Level): Routine checks, minor adjustments; minimal impact, can wait for planned downtime
